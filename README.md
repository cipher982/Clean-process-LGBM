# Clean-process-LGBM
Standard workflow of cleaning up data, preprocessing, and then running a classifier

Data cleaned up in development.ipynb
Data processed and developed the model in development_2.ipynb
Once data is saved in a pickle file (from dev2) you can run the train_eval.py file to run a light-GBM model on a chosen target feature.
